### Task Manager Demo

This project was done as a collaborative school project in my User Interface Design class, and was the first group project that I took the lead on.

It is fairly unorganized as we were all new to react development, but ultimately turned out to be a good learning experience.

### What I Worked On

I was in charge of making the main frontend page and the components you can see and interact with on the main page. I was also in charge of connecting all of the pages so that the application worked seemlessly. I also did the database work, but unfortunately as we were using a free database at the time, we no longer have access to it.
